# Learning GLFW without losing your sanity

This is a self-contained, pre-configured Visual Studio project for using GLFW 3.3.8.

No GLFW installation, no external dependencies required. Everything is ready.

This has been tested with Visual Studio 2019 (version 16.11.16) but should work for the other Visual Studio versions.

## All windows configurations supported

Supports x64 and x86 builds with both debug and release modes. (had to compile GLFW from scratch for this :') )

## How to use

-Get visual studio (NOT Visual Studio Code). Any version should do but I recommend [VS2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16).

-If installing Visual Studio, pick the "Desktop development with C++" package.

-Clone the repo.

-Open the `.sln` file.

-Run the program.

-???

-Profit.
